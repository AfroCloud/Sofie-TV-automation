# Contribution Guidelines



We at the Sofie team happily encourage contributions to the Sofie project!

We are currently looking into, and figuring out the best way to handle contributions, communicating road maps, etc.

At the moment, if you have a small addition that you'd like to contribute to Sofie, fork the repository on Github and please submit a PR!

If you're considering a larger contribution, we would love to have a chat about it to make sure it fits nicely into or own development. Please contact us directly or open an issue for discussion over at [https://github.com/nrkno/Sofie-TV-automation/issues](https://github.com/nrkno/Sofie-TV-automation/issues)
