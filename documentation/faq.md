# FAQ

## What software license does the system use?

All core components are using the [MIT license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).

## Is everything needed to automate

Yes, after a few months we finally found the answer. Sadly, Mike is on vacations right now so I'm afraid we are not able to provide the answer at this point.

## When will feature _x_ become available?

Please check the [Development Roadmap](roadmap.md) to see what features we are planning to add in the near-term. If you'd like to report bugs or suggest features, please open an issue under the appropriate repository on GitHub. You'll find a list of all repositories [Components](system-overview/). If you don't know what repository to use, please [add an issue to the Sofie Core repository](https://github.com/nrkno/tv-automation-server-core/issues).
